## 10/19/2025 - Initial Research + Harvested Battery cells  

Brainstormed the basics of the project, did some initial overview research. Found an old, unused USB power bank and harvested the cells. Has enough power for the project. Decided to integrate pixeldust into this project. Found the fans and their pinouts.![PXL_20251019_054817190.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a4fe63246a11dd07f3e09ff8571395b2d7f0da9b/PXL_20251019_054817190.jpg)
